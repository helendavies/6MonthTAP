\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Overview of previous TAP}
Here are the aims that I set in last TAP meeting:
\begin{itemize}
\item Decide on air chemistry set
\item Decide on air plasma geometry
\end{itemize}

Not part of collaboration any more.

\subsection{Motivation}
Here I will talk about air plasmas and lots of biology. 
Lots of examples of what plasmas, in particular air plasmas, can do. 
That'll keep the biologists happy.

\subsection{Confiuration}
Testing citation: \cite{Kolb2008cold}.

Overview of what others have done. Can use some pictures from the 1.2.17 lab meeting presentation I did.
Pictures in the emails from Deborah.

\subsection{Power Supply}
Nanosecond pulsing.
Why? What is the point? What does it mean? Why is it necessary for air and less so for noble gas plasmas?

\section{Air plasma model}
Whatever needs to go in here.... Vasco Guerra's air chem set....
